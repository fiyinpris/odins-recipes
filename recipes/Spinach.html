            Spinach pasta is a veggie-based pasta that is low in calaries and high in calcium, 
            fiber, antioxidants, and B vitamins. Spinach is high in vitamin A, a nutrient 
            that benefits the health of your eyes. The antioxidants of spinach are compounds 
            that helps protect your cells from damage. Spinach adds a beautiful color and 
            flavor to pasta when introduced to the mix. Getting the blend right can be tricky,
             but this recipe will show you how.

            <li>
              Combine water and ice in a bowl. Preheat a skillet over medium heat; add spinach.
               Cook, stirring continuously, until spinach turns bright green, about 30 seconds.
               Plunge into ice water bath; remove when spinach is lukewarm. Squeeze out excess 
               moisture with cheesecloth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine spinach, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a food processor; blend until smooth.
               Add flour; blend until dough no longer sticks to the blades, adding flour as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roll dough into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove plastic wrap from dough. Transfer to a work surface generously dusted with flour;
               cut dough into 4 pieces with a sharp knife. Roll out dough with a rolling pin to 1/4-inch 
               thickness; shape into rectangles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dust pasta maker rollers with flour. Run the dough rectangles through a pasta maker on
               the widest setting. Repeat rolling dough through rollers, gradually reducing the setting
                to desired thickness. Change the pasta maker's attachment to the preferred noodle shape;
                 cut pasta with the pasta maker.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Lower pasta gently into water; use a spoon to keep 
              noodles from sticking together. Cook until pasta is firm but soft, 3 to 6 minutes. 
              Remove from the water with tongs; transfer to a bowl.
