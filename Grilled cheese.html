                        Cheese is a great source of calcium, fat, and protein. It also contains high amounts of vitamins A
                        and B12, along with zinc, phosphorus, and riboflavin. According to U.S. Dairy, the overall
                        nutritional profile of conventional, organic, and grass-fed dairy products is similar. 
                        Dairy products, particularly cheese fortified with vitamin D, can be a great way to consume 
                        the correct balance of vitamins and minerals. Bottom Line: Increasing your calcium and protein
                        intake with cheese can keep your bones strong, and help prevent osteoporosis. As long as you 
                        don't have a sensitivity to lactose or dairy, eating cheese every day can be part of your healthy
                        eating plan. In addition to the protein and calcium benefits, cheese is a fermented food and can
                        supply a good source of probiotics for a healthy gut.
